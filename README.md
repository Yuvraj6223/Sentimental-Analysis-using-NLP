Note:
This project is designed to work on systems with sufficient computational resources.
For optimal performance, especially during model training and hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV), a machine with GPU support and at least 8â€“16 GB RAM is recommended.
If running on CPU-only systems, expect longer training times.
